## Using R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a file format that allows you to put code and non-code together in one document. For example, the shaded area below contains some code. Click on the green arrow in the upper right corner of the shaded area to run the code:


```{r math}
# add numbers together
10 + 9
```

The result of running the code appears below the shaded area.

Outside the shaded area you can type text just like in any word processing program. 

The code, results, and text can be compiled into a single document by using the `Knit` button at the top of the pane. Try `Knit to html` to see what happens before you complete the challenge! You can also make pdf and word documents, but the formatting is more complicated.

Before you begin, save this file. The file extension for markdown files is .Rmd.

## Challenge 

Write the code to answer each question in the shaded code chunks after the comment. Below the code chunks, write an interpretation of your results.

Start by running this code to import the data:

```{r data}
# import the data and name it smokers
smokers <- read.csv("http://tinyurl.com/z2m3cgq",
                    sep = ",", header = TRUE)
```

(1) Use numbers and a graph to compare the number of cigarettes smoked per day (numcigs) by marital status (marital_status). Write 1-2 sentences interpreting your results.

```{r question1}
# cigarettes smoked per day by marital status
by(data = smokers$numcigs, 
   INDICES = smokers$marital_status, 
   FUN = summary) 

# graph of cigarettes smoked per day by marital status
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = smokers, aes(x = marital_status, y = numcigs)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + 
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Marital status") + 
  ylab("Number of cigarettes per day") +
  ggtitle("Number cigarettes per day by marital status")    
```

Interpretation for 1: Divorced had the highest mean number of cigarettes per day while divorced and married both had a median number of cigarettes of 20, which is one pack. The box plot showed that married participants had a wider range of cigarettes smoked per day.

(2) Use the subset command to remove people with marital status of 9-Refused. Use the table command to see if it worked. Write a sentence interpreting the how many people were removed from the data frame.

```{r question2}
# subset data frame to delete 9-Refused marital status
smokers.noRefused <- subset(smokers, marital_status != "9-Refused")

# check to see if the subset command worked
table(smokers.noRefused$marital_status)
```

Interpretation for 2: The subset command removed the participants with Refused as marital status. One person was removed.

(3) Use appropriate numbers and graphs to describe the relationship between weight status (VBMI4CAT) and sex (sex). Interpret the results.

```{r question3}
# weight status by sex
table(weight.status = smokers$VBMI4CAT, sex = smokers$sex)

# graph of weight status by sex
# bar plot with facets
ggplot(data = smokers, 
       aes(x = VBMI4CAT)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(sex)) +
  xlab("Weight status") + 
  ylab("Sex") +
  ggtitle("Weight status by sex")

```

Interpretation for 3: Males have the most obese while females have the most healthy weight. The category of Tall seems out of place.

(4) Use subset to remove people with weight status of "Tall" and check your results.

```{r question4}
# subset data frame to delete Tall weight status
smokers.noTall <- subset(smokers, VBMI4CAT != "Tall")

# check to see if the subset command worked
table(smokers.noTall$VBMI4CAT)
```


(5) Use subset to remove blank values by putting nothing between the quotation marks to the right of the equal sign. Re-do the analysis from number (3). Compare the results with your results from number (3).

```{r question5}
# subset data frame to delete blank weight status
smokers.clean <- subset(smokers.noTall, VBMI4CAT != "")

# check to see if the subset command worked
table(smokers.clean$VBMI4CAT)

# weight status by sex
table(weight.status = smokers.clean$VBMI4CAT, sex = smokers.clean$sex)

# graph of weight status by sex
# bar plot with facets
ggplot(data = smokers.clean, 
       aes(x = VBMI4CAT)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(sex)) +
  xlab("Weight status") + 
  ylab("Sex") +
  ggtitle("Weight status by sex")

```

Interpretation for 5: No new interpretation of values, but the graph looks much easier to understand now.

(6) Use appropriate numbers and graphs to describe the relationship between age (age) and years smoking (yearssmoking). Interpret your results.

```{r}
# relationship between age and years smoking 
# correlation
cor(smokers$age, smokers$yearssmoking, use='complete')

# graph of relationship between age and years smoking
ggplot(data = smokers, aes(x = age, y = yearssmoking)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Relationship between age and years smoking")

```

Interpretation for 6: The correlation is .23, which is not that strong. There are two points on the graph that appear to have values that are too high for age.

(7) Take a subset of the data to delete the values of age that do not make sense and revise your graph and numbers from question 6. Explain what changed in your graph and numbers.

```{r  question7}
# subset age to delete problematic values
smokers.cleanAge <- subset(smokers, age < 100)

# correlation
cor(smokers.cleanAge$age, smokers.cleanAge$yearssmoking, use='complete')

# graph of relationship between age and years smoking
ggplot(data = smokers.cleanAge, aes(x = age, y = yearssmoking)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Relationship between age and years smoking")

```

Interpretation for 7: After removing the two values that were too high, the graph and correlation (r = .93) show a much stronger relationship between age and years of smoking. As people get older, they have smoked for longer.


Knit your document to check that it looks good. Make any edits needed. Once you are happy with the work, upload the R-Markdown file with the .Rmd file extension (not the knitted file) to Blackboard.
